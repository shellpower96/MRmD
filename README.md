# A Max-relevance-min-divergence Criterion for Data Discretization with Applications on Naive Bayes
`MRmD` is a supervised discretization framework that can balance discrimination power and generalization ability.

## Implementation
This is a source code of `MRmD` for a naive Bayes classifier using MATLAB. The version of MATLAB should be `>=2019b`.
- To successfully run the code, you need to install the `Bioinformatics Toolbox` and `Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox`.
* Download the source file, place it in MATLAB and then run the `main.m` file.

## Dataset
We provide a sample dataset `flare.data2` for one of the used datasets `flare-solar` in the paper.
The detailed descriptions of all datasets used in the paper can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php.
